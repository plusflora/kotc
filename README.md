## King of the Cove

### It's a page for the King of the Cove kiteboarding competition

### Things I want for this
- "landing"/home page
- About Page
- Media
- Past Results
- Sponsors/Thanks & Shout outs
- The Team/Who's putting it on/Who's working on the event

### Ideas/Spitballing

- All one page with a menu bar that will jump you to the page location
- "yewwwww" button. Dunno what it'll do but it'll be there.

### Random Notes
- trying the react version instead.
- wondering if this will give better interactivity or if I should go back to the classic html version.
